You should get these dependencies first:
  sdl + friends (just go into the package manager and install everything that looks like it belongs to sdl)
  libgl (mesa+libgl or working proprietary 3d drivers)
  freeglut
  guichan
  libmhash/mhash
  zlib/libz
  codeblocks (for building it)
You'll also need the -dev packages for all this with the exception of codeblocks if you use a distro that separates them. 

You can build it using codeblocks from the command line:
  codeblocks --build Projects/Linux/CodeBlocks/Khazad.cbp
Or open the project file in the codeblocks GUI and build it from there.

If all goes well, you'll have a Khazad binary.
